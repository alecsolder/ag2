    "0-20 (Irrelevant): The step has no meaningful connection to the plan's goal. It is either completely unrelated, counterproductive, or nonsensical in the context of the plan.\n",
    "30-40 (Low Relevance): The step has a weak or indirect connection to the goal. Its contribution is minimal and questionable. It might be tangentially related, but other steps would be far more effective.\n",
    "50-60 (Moderate Relevance): The step is somewhat relevant and contributes to the goal, but it's not essential. It's a supporting step rather than a driving force. The plan could likely succeed without it.\n",
    "70-80 (High Relevance): The step is highly relevant and makes a substantial contribution to the goal. It's an important part of the plan and significantly increases the likelihood of success.\n",
    "90-100 (Perfectly Relevant): The step is essential and highly impactful. It is one of the most critical steps, directly driving the goal. Without this step, the goal is likely unachievable.\n",
